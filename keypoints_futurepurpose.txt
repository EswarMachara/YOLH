CRITICAL RESOLUTION (MANDATORY BEFORE PHASE 2)

Fact confirmed:
Ultralytics does not provide a single model that outputs boxes + masks + keypoints.

Implication:
RefYOLO-Human must treat segmentation and pose as two vision sources until a unified backbone is implemented later (optional).

Required architectural decision (LOCK THIS):

Decision A (Recommended, minimal risk):

Use pose model as primary detector

Align segmentation masks to pose detections via IoU matching

One VisionOutput per image, assembled from two model outputs

Decision B (Deferred, higher risk):

Custom YOLO head unification (NOT now)

You already implicitly followed Decision A. This is correct.
We proceed assuming Decision A is locked.

No further changes needed in Phase 1
